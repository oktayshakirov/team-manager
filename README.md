# Team Management Tool
The Employee Management Tool is a software application that enables businesses to easily add new employees to a table and organize them by departments. The tool allows managers to input relevant employee information such as name, job title, contact details, and departmental assignment. The departmental grouping feature helps businesses to easily manage their workforce by creating a structured view of employee distribution. With this tool, businesses can quickly view the number of employees in each department, track their progress, and make informed decisions about resource allocation. This tool is an efficient and reliable solution for businesses looking to streamline their employee management processes.
